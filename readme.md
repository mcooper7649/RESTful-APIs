1. What is REST?
    - Representational State Transfer
    - Client makes a Request to the Server
    - VIA HTTP Request 
    - In our Callbacks | app.get(function(req, res){})  // The req is the request to the server
    - FTP is another common request you will see  
    - HTTPS is a Secure Request
    - If a Client makes a Valid request, then the Server should respond with the requested data, such as webpage or code.
    - RES is the RESPONSE we get back from the server
    - The RES can be processed on the serverside, like maybe a calculator app 
    - Sometimes the Server needs relevant data from the DB to fulfull the req
    - Sometimes res needs to be both data from the DB and to be processed serverside before being sent back to the client
    - The Server is limited in what it can do
    - APIs allows our Server to offer our client a wide variety of DATA

2. Rest is an Architectural Style
    - Similiar to buildings around the world with different Architecture
    - Rest is an Architectural Style for creating API's
    - Other APIs styles include SOAP, GraphQL, Falcor and many others
    - REST is the GOLD standard for Web APIs


3. REST was originally created to standardize the way the WEB APIs were created
    - This includes tons of rules to make it RESTful
    - Use HTTP Request Verbs
        - GET 
            - Similiar to Read in CRUD
            - app.get (We are familiar with app.get as a get request)
        - POST
            - Similiar to Create in CRUD
            - app.post (We are familiar with app.post as a post request)
        - PUT & PATCH (PATCH is new)
            - Both UPDATE like CRUD
            - app.put or app.patch with the callback
            - app.put will replace the current entry and replace it with a new document
            - app.patch will only send the piece of data that needs to be updated
        - DELETE
            - Similiar to the Delete in CRUD
            - app.delete with callback
    -  Use a Specific Pattern of Routes/Endpoint URLs


4. Creating a DB with Robo 3T
    - Before we get started, lets setup Robo 3T a GUI for mongoDB
    - localhost is the address
    - 27017 is the port
    - If network is unreachable we need to start the mongodb server | mongod
    - This allows us to create manage DB from GUI
    - Right Click on New Connection and Create a DB | WikiDB
    - Right Click on Collections and Click Create Collection  
        - Naming Convention for MongoDB Collections should be lowercase and plural
        - articles for our WikiDB
    - Right Click articles and Click View Documents and you will see the MongoDB code ran in the script bar above
        - db.getCollection('articles').find({})
        - you can use this confirm your code works before you add to your applications

5. Create a Document with Robo 3t
    - Right Click Articles and Click Insert Document 
        - Same as Create in CRUD
    - This Document will have two fields
        - Title: "REST"
        - Content: "Rest is short for Respresentational State Transfer, it's an architectural style for designing API's."
    - Right Click articles > View Documents
        - You should see our REST Document we just inserted
        - You will also see the ID that was generated by the creation of the document
        - You can right click and edit any properties of the document if you need to
