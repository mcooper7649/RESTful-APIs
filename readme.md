1. What is REST?
    - Representational State Transfer
    - Client makes a Request to the Server
    - VIA HTTP Request 
    - In our Callbacks | app.get(function(req, res){})  // The req is the request to the server
    - FTP is another common request you will see  
    - HTTPS is a Secure Request
    - If a Client makes a Valid request, then the Server should respond with the requested data, such as webpage or code.
    - RES is the RESPONSE we get back from the server
    - The RES can be processed on the serverside, like maybe a calculator app 
    - Sometimes the Server needs relevant data from the DB to fulfull the req
    - Sometimes res needs to be both data from the DB and to be processed serverside before being sent back to the client
    - The Server is limited in what it can do
    - APIs allows our Server to offer our client a wide variety of DATA

2. Rest is an Architectural Style
    - Similiar to buildings around the world with different Architecture
    - Rest is an Architectural Style for creating API's
    - Other APIs styles include SOAP, GraphQL, Falcor and many others
    - REST is the GOLD standard for Web APIs


3. REST was originally created to standardize the way the WEB APIs were created
    - This includes tons of rules to make it RESTful
    - Use HTTP Request Verbs
        - GET 
            - Similiar to Read in CRUD
            - app.get (We are familiar with app.get as a get request)
        - POST
            - Similiar to Create in CRUD
            - app.post (We are familiar with app.post as a post request)
        - PUT & PATCH (PATCH is new)
            - Both UPDATE like CRUD
            - app.put or app.patch with the callback
            - app.put will replace the current entry and replace it with a new document
            - app.patch will only send the piece of data that needs to be updated
        - DELETE
            - Similiar to the Delete in CRUD
            - app.delete with callback
    -  Use a Specific Pattern of Routes/Endpoint URLs


4. Creating a DB with Robo 3T
    - Before we get started, lets setup Robo 3T a GUI for mongoDB
    - localhost is the address
    - 27017 is the port
    - If network is unreachable we need to start the mongodb server | mongod
    - This allows us to create manage DB from GUI
    - Right Click on New Connection and Create a DB | WikiDB
    - Right Click on Collections and Click Create Collection  
        - Naming Convention for MongoDB Collections should be lowercase and plural
        - articles for our WikiDB
    - Right Click articles and Click View Documents and you will see the MongoDB code ran in the script bar above
        - db.getCollection('articles').find({})
        - you can use this confirm your code works before you add to your applications

5. Create a Document with Robo 3t
    - Right Click Articles and Click Insert Document 
        - Same as Create in CRUD
    - This Document will have two fields
        - Title: "REST"
        - Content: "Rest is short for Respresentational State Transfer, it's an architectural style for designing API's."
    - Right Click articles > View Documents
        - You should see our REST Document we just inserted
        - You will also see the ID that was generated by the creation of the document
        - You can right click and edit any properties of the document if you need to 
        - Add the 3 examples below to complete the next step

```
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("5c139771d79ac8eac11e754a"),
    "title" : "API",
    "content" : "API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of subroutine definitions, communication protocols, and tools for building software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication among various components. A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer."
}


{
    "_id" : ObjectId("5c1398aad79ac8eac11e7561"),
    "title" : "Bootstrap",
    "content" : "This is a framework developed by Twitter that contains pre-made front-end templates for web design"
}


{
    "_id" : ObjectId("5c1398ecd79ac8eac11e7567"),
    "title" : "DOM",
    "content" : "The Document Object Model is like an API for interacting with our HTML"
}

```

6.  CodeWiki-API

    - Create a new Directory called WIKI-API
    - Init NPM
    - Install body-parser, mongoose, ejs, and express
    - Create a file called, app.js
    - Inside app.js add server code (Write/Copy)
        - This incldues requiring code and setting up mongoose
    - Setup MongoDB
        - DB name should be wikiDB
        - Collection name is articles 
        - Document has 2 fields: title and content


7. Find an Article (GET)
    - using app.get request
        - Submit a find, to find all articles
        - go to localhost:3000/articles to trigger GET request and see the console log of the results
        - add res.send(results) and now the page will return the results like we've seen with APIs
```
app.get("/articles", function (req, res) {
    Article.find({}, function (err, results) {
        if (!err){
        console.log(results)
        res.send(results)
    }else{
        console.log(err)
        res.send(err)
    }})
})
```

8. Create a new Article (POST)

    - This one is tricky because the client needs to send data to the server and we don't have a frontend
    - We can use a TOOL called PostMAN to send and test our API without needing a frontend at all
    - Create the app.post with "/articles" as per the POST methodology
        - add console.log req.body title and content
    - Make a post on Postman and you should see the logs of the post
    - Cool! Now we need it to save to the DB though
    - Declare new const newArticle and use new keyword to assign to Article Model.
    - add req.body title and content for required fields
    - call save method on newArticle
    - Test by Submitting a post via postman again
    - Confirm via get request or robo3t
    - Add data validation so postman doesn't hange
        - Inside the save method we can add a callback
   

```
app.post("/articles", function (req, res) {
console.log(req.body.title);
console.log(req.body.content);


const newArticle = new Article({
    title: req.body.title,
    content: req.body.content
});

newArticle.save(function(err){
    if (!err){
        res.send("Sucessfully added a new article")
    } else {
        res.send(err)
    }
});

});
```
